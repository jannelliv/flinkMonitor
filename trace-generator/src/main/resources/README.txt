Usage: generator.sh {-S | -L | -T | -P <pattern>} [options 1...] [<trace length>]

       OR

       generator.sh -sig <sig_file> [options 2...] [<trace length>]

Common options:

    <trace length>
            The length of the trace in seconds. If not specified, an unbounded
            stream is generated.

    -seed <number>
            Sets the seed for the random generator

    -e <event rate>
            The total number of events per second (default: 10).

    -i <index rate>
            The number of indices or time-points per second (default: 1).

    -t <timestamp>
            The initial timestamp used for the first events (default: 0).


Options 1:

    -S | -L | -T
            Selects the star, linear, or triangle event pattern (see below).
            Exactly one of these (or -P) must be selected.

    -P <pattern>
            Specifies a custom event pattern. A pattern consists of three event
            names, each followed by a comma-separated list of variables
            enclosed in parentheses.


    -x <violation ratio>
            The frequency of violations, relative to the total number of
            events (default: 0.01).

    -w <interval>
            The interval in seconds between base and implied events, and
            between implied and forbidden events (default: 10).

    -pA <event ratio A>
            The relative frequency of event type A (default: 0.33).

    -pB <event ratio B>
            The relative frequency of event type B (default: 0.33).

    -z <Zipf exponents>
            Selects the Zipf distribution instead the uniform distribution for
            some variables. The argument is a comma-separated list of
            assignments <var>=<exp>[+<off>], where <var> is the name of
            variable, <exp> is the non-negative exponent of the Zipf
            distribution, and <off> is an optional offset. For example, if
            <off> is 100, the distribution has support {101, 102, ...}, with
            101 being the most frequent value.


Options 2:

    -q <sample queue size>
            The size of the queue containing the most recently sampled unique
            data values (default: 100)

    -r <fresh value rate>
            Probability to sample a fresh value (not among the q most recent)
            (default: 0.1)


General description:
---------------------

The stream generator prints a random stream of timestamped events to the
standard output. The generator produces a finite trace instead if a length is
specified. In either case, the sequence of events is produced at once and not
as a real-time stream. Simultaneous events are grouped into time-points, which
are also called indices. The number of indices per second can be changed by
specifying option -i. The total number of events per second is set with option -e.

Events are parametrized by data values. Two events are said to match if the
corresponding data values are equal.

Overall, the output consists of lines with the following format, each
representing a single event:

    <event name>, tp=<index>, ts=<timestamp>, x0=<value 1>, x1=<value 2>, ...

Indexes and timestamps start at zero. A different starting timestamp can be set
with option -t.

There are two modes of event generation: based on a fixed set of events (option 1)
or based on an arbitrary set of events (option 2).

Option 1:
----------

There are three types of events:

  - Base events (type A).

  - Implied events (type B). For every base event, a matching implied event is
    added within the specified interval (option -w).

  - Forbidden events (type C). A forbidden event that matches both a B event in
    the preceding interval and an A event before that (within another interval
    of the same size) constitutes a violation.

Events of the three types are generated randomly and independently according
to the event ratios -pA and -pB. The ratio of type C is implied by the ratios
of type A and B because the sum is always 1. By default, all three types are
equally likely. The frequency of violations relative to the number of events
can be set with option -x.

The correspondence of the events' data values must either be specified as
a custom pattern, or selected from a set of built-in patterns. A pattern
consists of names for the three event types, each followed by a non-empty list
variables. The names are used for printing the events. Whenever a variable
appears in multiple places, then those places correspond to each other, and
they must have equal values in a match. A custom pattern is supplies as
a single argument after option -P. For example,

    generator.sh -P "e1(x)e2(x,y,z)e3(y,z)" 10

generates a 10 second trace, where the names of the event types A, B, and C are
e1, e2, and e3, respectively. Events e1 have one data values, while events e2
have three. They match if they agree on their first (or only) value. Events e2
and e3 match if the second and third value of e2 are equal to the first and
second value of e3. Event and variable names can be arbitrary alphanumeric
strings, including hyphens and underscores.

The built-in patterns are as follows:

    -S      Star pattern: A(w,x), B(w,y), C(w,z)
    -L      Linear pattern: A(w,x), B(x,y), C(y,z)
    -T      Triangle pattern: A(x,y), B(y,z), C(z,x)

By default, data values are chosen uniformly between 0 and 999 999 999. It is
also possible to select a Zipf distribution per variable. The exponents are
passed as an argument after option -z, together with optional offsets. For
example,

    generator.sh -T -z "x=1.5,z=2+100" 10

generates events according to the triangle pattern, where variable x follows
a Zipf distribution with exponent 1.5 and support {1, 2, ...}. Variable z
follows a Zipf distribution with exponent 2 and support {101, 102, ...}.
Variable y has a uniform distribution.

Note that violations always have uniform values to prevent accidental
matchings. For the same reason, Zipf-distributed values of type C events start
at 1 000 001.

Option 2:
----------

Events are defined by a signature file. It must be supplied via the -sig flag.
The format of the signature file is as follows:

(<Event name>\(\) | <Event name>\(<Variable name>(,<Variable name>)*\))*

New lines are optional, but can occur only after each full event definition.
Spaces are normalized as usual.

In this mode the generator keeps a configurable number (flag -q) of unique most
recently sampled data values. With a configurable probability (flag -r), the
generator samples new values (not among the most recent).
