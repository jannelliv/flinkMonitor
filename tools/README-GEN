Additional options:
--------------------

If used as a component of the infsec/benchmark docker image 
generator supports these additional options.

    -et
            Flag -et stands for emission time.
            Instructs the generator to create out-of-order events
            with explicit emission times. More specifically, each 
            eventâ€™s emission time is additionally delayed by a value
            sampled from a truncated normal distribution N(0,s) over 
            the interval [0, md). The generator also adds 
            watermarks to the trace which are special time-stamps
            that represent a lower bound on future event time-stamps.
            This feature uses an extended format for the lines in 
            the output:

            <emission time>'<previously defined format>  |  <emission time>'>WATERMARK <timestamp><

    -md <int>
           Flag -md stands for maximum delay (default value: 5). 
           It defines the maximum time any event can be delayed. In 
           practice this is the maximum different between event's
           time-stamp and emission time. When set, flag -et is 
           implicitly set.

    -s  <float>
          Flag -s defined the standard deviation of the truncated 
          normal distribution used to sample emission times
          (default value: 2.0). When set, flag -et is implicitly set.

    -wp <int>
           Flag -wp stands for watermark period (default value: 2). 
           It defines how often watermarks are generated by the 
           generator. When set, flag -et is implicitly set.
